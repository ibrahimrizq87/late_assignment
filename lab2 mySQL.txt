    the code above did not work for some resone. When I did search about it some resources sayes that some versions of mysql dose not support this kind of command so i did the following insted 
    
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE SubjectMaxScores AS
SELECT 
    Subject.name AS subject_name, 
    MAX(Exam.score) AS max_score
FROM 
    Subject
JOIN 
    Exam ON Subject.subjectID = Exam.subjectID
GROUP BY 
    Subject.subjectID;



22.
DELETE FROM Student
WHERE studentID IN (
    SELECT studentID
    FROM Exam
    WHERE score < 50
);
